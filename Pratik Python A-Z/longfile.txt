Although most of the time the styles of a web-page's author would suffice, the Opera browser has long provide
d facilities for its users to modify the appearance of the page, and all recent Opera versions up to and including
12.17 allow user style-sheets. Versions beyond this point, version 15.xx was essentially next, have not permitted such 
facilities. The 12.17 version is perhaps preferred over 12.16 for those who like the old style, since it was created to fix the Heartbleed bug.
To continue, the local user can provide several style-sheets, one for general use that affects every page, and others that 
are used instead when specific pages are opened. The browser also has a number of built-in style sheets to improve viewing for the visually impaired and for testing.
Changed styles are perhaps best regarded for making a page easier to read, but the study of the CSS cascade itself requires
 an ability in styles adjustment. Another more obvious use is the design of a web-page, where endless testing is the rule as opposed to the exception.
Contrary to popular belief, those interested in studying styles need not purchase expensive program packages. Whereas suc
h programs have advantages for those seeking quick results the web itself is the best source of examples, and can be studied at 
any time. With the introduction of web-developer software to browsers all of the necessary features are already available.
This page explains how to configure the style settings of the Opera 12.16 browser for its main areas of use, and provides so
me sample text files and tutorials to assist in their study.
